# How it works

[Betttr](https://betttr.xyz) is a Frame V2 app on Farcaster that lets users place bets on Base using any token from any chain, powered by [Daimo Pay](https://pay.daimo.com/).
It runs on the [Azuro protocol](https://azuro.org/) on Base, a permissionless sports and prediction market protocol that provides odds, event data, and deep liquidity for seamless betting.

## How bets work

Each bet consists of one or more pairs of conditions (e.g., _"Who will win the match between Team A and Team B?"_) and outcomes (e.g., _"Team A"_, _"Team B"_, _"Draw"_).

A 1% standard protocol fee applies to all bets. For copy bets, the original bettor earns a minimum referral fee of 1%. Fees may change during special promotions or incentive programs.

## Social Betting at Its Core

What makes Betttr unique is its social-first approach. This mini app isn't just about betting—it's about proving your skills, building a reputation, and engaging with the community. Since everything is built on public, permissionless protocols, we can offer features that wouldn't be possible in closed ecosystems:

- Social Leaderboard – Track top bettors and their performance across different sports and markets.
- Copy Betting – Instantly copy bets from others and reward expert bettors with referral fees.
- Bettor Subscriptions – Follow specific users and get notified when they place bets.
- Shared Bets – Easily share bets as Frames on Farcaster for others to interact with.

Over the next few weeks, we'll be experimenting and iterating with users to prioritize these social features.

## Betttr smart contract

Betttr is powered by a single smart contract called AzuroHandler, which is designed solely to place bets on the Azuro protocol while retaining platform fees. These fees are divided into two categories:

Protocol Fee: 1% – This fee helps maintain and sustain the protocol's operations.
Referral Fee: 1% – If the bet is a copybet, the original referrer earns this fee. Otherwise, the referral fee is 0%.

The AzuroHandler contract is deployed on Base at: [0x0DF4eA14FA3E288Ce48fCb25a9D1Aa7c6CaFD984](https://basescan.org/address/0x0DF4eA14FA3E288Ce48fCb25a9D1Aa7c6CaFD984)
